# Frontend Improvement Plan (React + TypeScript)

## Overview
This plan outlines the completed improvements and future proposals to enhance maintainability, performance, developer experience, and scalability.

---

## Completed Improvements

- **Migrated from Create React App to Vite** for faster builds and modern tooling
- **Enabled React Query** for API data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **Centralized API services** using Axios
- **Added Storybook** for component documentation and visual testing
- **Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD** for automated linting, testing, and building
- **Added lint and test scripts** compatible with Vite and Vitest
- **Updated README** with setup, scripts, and architecture info
- **Created developer onboarding guide**
- **Configured strict TypeScript options**
- **Improved accessibility** with audits and best practices
- **Consistent theming** with MUI and Tailwind
- **Dark/light mode toggle** (planned)
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** for API mocking in tests

---

## Remaining / Future Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimization
- Further code splitting & lazy loading
- Analyze bundle size with visualizers
- Optimize images & assets
- Enhance service worker caching strategies

### 2. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Expand integration and e2e test coverage
- Accessibility audits with Lighthouse and jest-axe

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements
- Improve ARIA labels, focus management, color contrast
- Finalize dark/light mode toggle
- Expand Storybook stories for all components

### 4. API Integration
- Add global error boundaries and toast notifications
- Document API contracts with Swagger/OpenAPI

### 5. CI/CD & Automation
- Enforce code quality gates before merge
- Add preview deployments (Vercel, Netlify)

---
 
## TODO / Future Improvements

- **Error Boundaries & User Feedback:** Implement global error boundaries and user-friendly error/toast notifications for all API failures and unexpected errors.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Add PWA support for offline access, installability, and better mobile experience.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Integrate tools like Sentry or LogRocket for real-time frontend error and performance monitoring.
- **Accessibility:** Automate accessibility testing (e.g., with axe-core or Lighthouse CI) in your CI pipeline.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Add Cypress or Playwright for robust e2e tests covering critical user flows.
- **Component Library:** Consider extracting reusable UI components into a shared library for future projects or microfrontends.
- **API Mocking for Dev/CI:** Expand use of MSW to mock all backend endpoints for frontend development and CI.
- **Security:** Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and audit dependencies for vulnerabilities (e.g., with npm audit or Snyk).

## Summary
The frontend has been modernized with Vite, React Query, Storybook, CI/CD, and improved documentation. Remaining work focuses on performance, testing, UI/UX polish, and API documentation.
