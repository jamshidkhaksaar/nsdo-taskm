# Backend Improvement Plan (NestJS)

## Overview
This plan documents the completed improvements and future proposals to enhance security, scalability, maintainability, and developer experience.

---

## Completed Improvements

- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Global rate limiting with `@nestjs/throttler`
  - CSRF protection with `csurf` middleware
  - Security headers with Helmet
  - IP whitelisting middleware for admin routes
  - API key guard for external integrations
  - Disabled Swagger UI in production

- **API Design:**
  - Versioned API prefix `/api/v1`
  - Global exception filter for consistent error responses
  - Pagination and filtering DTOs for list endpoints

- **Performance & Scalability:**
  - Redis caching with `cache-manager-redis-store`
  - Asynchronous processing with BullMQ queues
  - Health checks with `@nestjs/terminus` (database ping, `/health` endpoint)

- **Documentation:**
  - Enabled Swagger/OpenAPI docs (protected in production)

- **Developer Experience:**
  - Modular NestJS 11 architecture
  - Strict TypeScript
  - DTO validation with class-validator
  - Environment configs for dev/test/prod
  - Testing setup with Jest
  - CI/CD pipelines (planned)

## Remaining / Future Improvements

### 1. Database & Migrations
- Adopt TypeORM CLI migrations fully
- Add seed scripts for initial data

### 2. Performance & Observability
- Add Prometheus metrics
- Optimize DB queries (indexes, avoid N+1)
- Structured logging (Winston or Pino)
- Request tracing with correlation IDs
- Error monitoring (Sentry)

### 3. Testing & CI/CD
- Expand integration and e2e test coverage
- Automate pipelines for lint, test, build, deploy
- Enforce code quality gates before merge

### 4. Developer Experience
- Improve Swagger docs with examples and error codes
- Add Makefile or scripts for common dev tasks
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Summary
The backend has been significantly improved with security, API design, caching, async processing, and monitoring. Remaining work focuses on database migrations, observability, and developer tooling.
