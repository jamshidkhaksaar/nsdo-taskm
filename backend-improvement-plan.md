# Backend Improvement Plan (NestJS)

## Overview
This plan outlines the current strengths of the backend and proposes targeted improvements to enhance security, scalability, maintainability, and developer experience.

---

## Strengths
- **Modern NestJS 11 architecture** with modular design
- **TypeScript 5.7** with strict type safety
- **Role-based access control** with JWT and 2FA (speakeasy, qrcode)
- **Comprehensive feature coverage**: tasks, departments, users, notifications, backup/restore
- **Swagger API documentation**
- **Environment separation** with `.env` files for dev, test, prod
- **Validation** using class-validator and class-transformer
- **Testing setup** with Jest
- **Linting and formatting** with ESLint + Prettier
- **Database support** for MySQL (and optional Postgres)
- **Migration scripts** for schema updates

---

## Improvement Plan

### 1. Database & Migrations
- **Adopt TypeORM migrations fully**  
  Replace raw SQL scripts with TypeORM CLI migrations (`typeorm migration:generate`) for better version control and rollback.
- **Add seed scripts**  
  For initial data like roles, admin user, default departments.

### 2. Security Enhancements
- **Rate limiting**  
  Use `@nestjs/throttler` to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **CSRF protection**  
  Especially for admin panel endpoints.
- **API key management**  
  For external integrations.
- **IP whitelisting**  
  For sensitive admin routes.
- **Swagger UI protection**  
  Require auth or disable in production.
- **Security headers**  
  Add Helmet middleware.

### 3. API Design
- **Versioning**  
  Implement API versioning (`/v1/`, `/v2/`) to support future changes.
- **Consistent error handling**  
  Use global filters for standardized error responses.
- **Pagination and filtering**  
  Standardize query params for list endpoints.

### 4. Performance & Scalability
- **Caching**  
  Integrate Redis for caching frequent queries (e.g., user profiles, department stats).
- **Asynchronous processing**  
  Use queues (e.g., BullMQ) for email sending, notifications, backups.
- **Monitoring**  
  Add Prometheus metrics and health checks.
- **Optimize DB queries**  
  Add indexes, avoid N+1 queries.

### 5. Observability & Logging
- **Structured logging**  
  Integrate Winston or Pino for better logs.
- **Request tracing**  
  Use correlation IDs for tracing requests.
- **Error monitoring**  
  Integrate Sentry or similar.

### 6. Testing & CI/CD
- **Expand test coverage**  
  More integration and e2e tests.
- **Automate pipelines**  
  Lint, test, build, deploy with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
- **Code quality gates**  
  Enforce coverage and lint checks before merge.

### 7. Developer Experience
- **Improve API docs**  
  Add detailed Swagger descriptions, examples, error codes.
- **Use DTOs everywhere**  
  Enforce strict DTO validation.
- **Update dependencies regularly**  
  Keep NestJS and packages up to date.
- **Add Makefile or scripts**  
  For common dev tasks (start, test, migrate, seed).

## Summary
This plan aims to harden security, improve maintainability, and prepare the backend for future growth. Prioritize security and migration improvements first, then focus on observability, performance, and developer experience.
