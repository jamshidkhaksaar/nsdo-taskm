- Tabbed interface for different task views
- Recycle bin with restore functionality
- Delegation tracking and monitoring
```

**PRD Compliance:**

## 🔧 Integration Recommendations

### 1. Dashboard Integration

Update the main Dashboard component to include the Board View tab:

```typescript
// In Dashboard.tsx - Add new tab
const tabs = [
  { label: 'Task List', component: <TaskListView /> },
  { label: 'Board View', component: <TaskKanbanBoard 
    tasks={allTasks}
    onTaskStatusChange={handleTaskStatusChange}
    onTaskClick={handleTaskClick}
    onTaskDelete={handleTaskDelete}
    loading={loading}
    currentUser={currentUser}
  /> },
];
```

### 2. Navigation Updates

Add Tasks Overview to the sidebar navigation:

```typescript
// For Leadership and Admin roles only
{
  title: 'Tasks Overview',
  path: '/tasks-overview',
  icon: <AssessmentIcon />,
  roles: ['Leadership', 'Admin']
}
```

### 3. API Service Extensions

Enhance TaskService with new methods:

```typescript
// Additional methods needed
class TaskService {
  static async restoreTask(taskId: string): Promise<void> { /* implementation */ }
  static async getDelegations(): Promise<DelegationInfo[]> { /* implementation */ }
  static async getRecycleBinTasks(): Promise<RecycleBinTask[]> { /* implementation */ }
  static async getTaskStatistics(filters: FilterOptions): Promise<TaskStats> { /* implementation */ }
}
```

```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimizations
- **Virtualization**: For large task lists (>1000 items)
- **Pagination**: Server-side pagination for Tasks Overview
- **Caching**: React Query for efficient data caching
- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy load chart components

### Backend Optimizations
- **Database Indexing**: Index on task status, assignee, creator
