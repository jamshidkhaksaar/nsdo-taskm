## Recycle Bin and Task Management Enhancements - Implementation Plan

### Requirements Analysis
- Core Requirements:
  - [x] Create recycle bin page for deleted tasks with search and filter functionality
  - [x] Implement deletion comment requirement (min 20 words) with task deletion
  - [x] Implement cancellation comment requirement with status update to cancelled
  - [x] Add metadata tracking for task deletions and cancellations
  - [x] Restrict recycle bin access to admin and leadership roles

- Technical Constraints:
  - [x] Need to modify task entity to store deletion/cancellation metadata
  - [x] Maintain task references for reporting and analytics 
  - [x] Ensure proper integration with existing task management workflow
  - [x] Apply consistent UI patterns with the rest of the application

### Component Analysis
- Affected Components:
  - Backend:
    - Task Entity: Add deletion metadata fields
    - Tasks Service: Modify delete and status update methods
    - Tasks Controller: Add recycle bin endpoints
    - DTOs: Create new DTOs for deletion/cancellation
  
  - Frontend:
    - Admin UI: Create new recycle bin page
    - Task Dialogs: Add deletion reason dialog
    - Task Status Updates: Add cancellation reason dialog
    - Sidebar: Add recycle bin navigation item
    - API Services: Add recycle bin data fetching

### Design Decisions
- Architecture:
  - [x] Soft delete approach (mark as deleted but retain in database)
  - [x] New deletion_metadata table vs embedded JSON field decision
  - [x] Permission structure for viewing deleted tasks
  
- UI/UX:
  - [x] Design Recycle Bin admin page layout with sorting/filtering

   - [x] Add validation for deletion/cancellation reasons
   - [x] Modify task status update endpoints
   - [x] Create recycle bin data retrieval endpoints

2. Frontend Changes (Phase 2):
   - [x] Add deletion reason dialog component
   - [x] Add cancellation reason dialog component
   - [x] Modify task deletion workflow
   - [x] Modify task status update workflow
   - [x] Add recycle bin to admin sidebar menu
   - [x] Create recycle bin page with search/filter capabilities
