# Backup Module

This module provides backup and restore functionality for the system. It allows administrators to create, manage, and restore system backups.

## Endpoints

### GET /api/backups
Returns a list of all available backups.

### GET /api/backups/:id
Returns details for a specific backup.

### POST /api/backups/create_backup
Creates a new backup with the specified options.

Example request body:
```json
{
  "type": "full",
  "location": "/custom/backup/path",
  "includeDatabases": true,
  "includeMedia": true,
  "includeSettings": true
}
```

### POST /api/backups/:id/restore
Restores the system from a backup.

### DELETE /api/backups/:id
Deletes a backup.

### GET /api/backups/:id/download
Downloads a backup file.

## Implementation Details

The current implementation uses an in-memory store to simulate backup functionality. In a production environment, you would need to implement:

1. Database backup mechanism
2. File system backup mechanism
3. Appropriate storage for backup files
4. Secure restore functionality with appropriate validation

## Security Considerations

- Only users with ADMIN role can access these endpoints
- Backup and restore operations should be audited
- Backup files should be stored securely
- Consider encryption for sensitive backup data
