I am creating a Task management full stack app with Django and Typescript and React, 

I have developed the below parts: 

Frontend: 
1. Sign in page (Only users added by admin can sign in with username and password) No remember me is included. 
2. User Dashboard (This user includes a Topbar widget with greeting message and weather and time, also on the right left there is a menu for user profile and user settings)
in the center I have implemented a My Tasks, which I can add my tasks change the status of task from upcoming to in progress and done. 
also in the bottom I have implmeneted Tasks assigned to me and Tasks assigned by me the concept of this is if i want to assign a task to someone I can click on assign task and search for username and select the user and give the task a title a description a deadline and priority. 
the same is if someone want to assign a task to me so once the user assign a task to me I must see that task in Tasks assigned to me component. 
also I have a footer which has two icons and github and linkend. and the developer name Jamshid Khaksaar 
3. in the left i have a sidebar menu 
the menu stracture is: 

Dashboard 
Departments 
Users 

1. Departments menu
in this menu I have implemented a list of departments which will be created by admin from admin panel and must be showing here, so the users can interact with departments, a user can search for a department and assign a task to a department, so we have these features in the Departments:
Departments List
All Departments Summary (Which a graph or line that shows the performance of a department technically means how much upcoming tasks they are completed. 
Total Tasks all tasks assigned to the department 
Overall Progress show the performance of the department for onging tasks. 
Top Performers show the most active department completing the tasks. 
Upcoming Tasks when clicking a department name in the component it must show the upcoming tasks and the users must be able to click on assign task to department and have a create task dialog open (Title, Description of Task, Priority, Deadline) so the department must be able to see who assigned the task. 
Ongoing Tasks the same here when the department is working on a upcoming task they will change the status to ongoing so the users can see who started working on that task here. 
Completed Tasks the same here when the department or the user is finished the tasks or completed they can change the status of task to completed and must be show in the Completed tasks. 

4. Users page
we do have another menu in the left side for users, here a user can exclusivly assign a task to another user this page have these menus or components: 

Users List: User can see a list of all registered users and can select a user to assign a task to the user. 
​
Search users... also a search option 


Upcoming Tasks User can see assigned tasks by other user the users and is able to assign a task to the users which also open create task dialog (Title, Task Description, Priority, Deadline) 
Ongoing Tasks: once the user change the status of a upcoming task it must be move to the ongoing tasks
Completed Tasks and once the user is completed the task it can change again the status of the task to completed 
for all of this the user must see which user is assigned the task on which date and time. 

This is all for end users registered by admin: below is now for the admin user with admin previliges:

This app is almost completed from frontend but we need the backend which is also incomplete, we do user the Django Rest framwork api, kindly create a markdown file so that it is easy for an app developer to understand and implement, user the context over to write this.
